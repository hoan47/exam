I appreciate the offer of the complimentary delivery, but I think I would like to just go ahead and set up regular deliveries. I may be interested in setting up a year's worth of deliveries, but I would first like to get a list of the range of produce that you will be offering through the different seasons. As I own a vegetarian restaurant, I will need to have an idea of the types of produce that will be delivered so I can prepare my menus accordingly. Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to working with Bountiful Harvest!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kind regards,</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Emily Hall</p>"

Mika and Jonas tied for second in the downhill race, and Dylan came in third in cross-country. However, there were a few minor issues.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Serena Kitamura (7:16 P.M.)</strong><br>Really? What happened?</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Alex Salinas (7:17 P.M.)</strong><br>Well, Mika had trouble with her brakes—we got them fixed before the next race. Besides that, Dylan pulled a muscle in his leg on one of the uphill climbs. He should be okay by tomorrow, though.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Serena Kitamura (7:18 P.M.)</strong><br>Incidentally, this week we’ve seen a pretty significant bump in the online sales of our steel-frame bicycles. In fact, we sold over 30 units just today. I’m glad we at Ridgeorad Eagle decided to be a sponsor of this year’s Cycloquest.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Alex Salinas (7:19 P.M.)</strong><br>Yes, it really worked out well, didn’t it?</p>"
